\# Team Landing Page - Planning



\## 1) Brainstormed Features / Elements

\- Team landing page with team title

\- Display each team member as a card (avatar + name)

\- Clicking a member avatar/name opens that member’s profile page

\- Basic styling for layout (spacing, border, alignment)

\- Responsive design using flex-wrap (cards wrap on small screens)



\## 2) User Stories

\- As a visitor, I want to see all team members on one page so that I can know who is on the team.

\- As a visitor, I want to click a team member’s avatar so that I can open their individual profile page.

\- As a visitor, I want the page to be organized and styled so that it is easy to read and navigate.



\## 3) MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Minimum features required for the project to function:

\- index.html displays all team members with avatars and names

\- Each avatar links to the correct profile page in /profiles

\- Basic styling is applied using css/style.css

\- Project uses the required folder structure and naming rules

\- planning.md is included inside the docs/ folder



\## 4) MoSCoW (Must / Should / Could / Won’t)

\### Must Have

\- Correct project folder structure (css, docs, images/avatars, profiles)

\- index.html shows each team member with avatar + name

\- Clicking a team member opens their profile page

\- css/style.css provides basic styling

\- Each member profile page is named: \[name]\_profile.html

\- Each member avatar is named: \[name]\_avatar.png

\- Each member personal CSS is named: \[name]\_style.css

\- planning.md completed



\### Nice to Have (Should Have)

\- Hover effect on team member cards

\- Short team introduction text

\- Consistent image sizes



\### Could Have

\- Social links (GitHub/LinkedIn) on each profile

\- Dark mode theme



\### Won’t Have (Out of Scope)

\- Backend/database/login

\- Complex JavaScript features



\## 5) Constraints and Assumptions

\- Static website only (HTML + CSS)

\- Time is limited, so we focus on MVP first

\- Assume each team member provides their own avatar and profile content

\- Filenames must follow the required naming format exactly
